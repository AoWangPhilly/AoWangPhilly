## Hi there, I'm Ao Wang! 👨‍💻

I'm currently a sophomore Computer Science major at Drexel University. In Fall 2020, I'll be working as a Software Developer Co-op at Vanguard! I'm currently based in Philadelphia, PA.

Since my freshman year of high school, I've always enjoyed programming. The first thing I ever programmed was my TI-84 calculator, and I still love it. Now, I'm trying to get into competitive programming and creating a ton of fun applications! 🤩
